# UnderStanding

## Stage
Logical code is the most easy code although experience programmer's code is better,a programmer would be weed out if he only focus on improving the capacity of logical coding.

so i have to decide to go to another company, which could provide a better platform to learn more.And now ,i'm in a good company which could let me live better,working better, and learn better.

My last leader always said the project or framework designed by others is only for use and there is no need to deep into it to UnderStanding.what's more, he encouraged me to think like him, woking like him and live like him. I respect his carrer planning by spitting it. I know i have to leave to prevent myself from becomming one like him, no matter how salary he provide.

After reviewing and self-learning for a long period, i start my critical period of seeking job.I went to alibaba, jingdong, and other companies for interviews and finally i'm here now.

Enjoying the happiness of success of seeking job, i have reached a new stage of my life. The pass has gone and i need to get out of it. A new start is comming and here comes a new day.
