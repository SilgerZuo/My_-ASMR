# UnderStanding

## Stage
Logical code is the most easy code although experience programmer's code is better,
a programmer would be weed out if he only focus on improving the capacity of
logical coding.

so i have to decide to go to another company, which could provide a better platform
to learn more.And now ,i'm in a good company which could let me live better,
working better, and learn better.

My last leader always said the project or framework designed by others is only
for use and there is no need to deep into it to UnderStanding.what's more, he
encouraged me to think like him, woking like him and live like him. I respect his
carrer planning by spit it. I know i have to leave to prevent myself becomming one
like him, no matter how salary he provide.
